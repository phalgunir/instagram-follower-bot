This bot helps you follow (or unfollow) all the followers of a particular instagram account.           

This helps new business accounts to build their following. 
They can target a similar account to theirs and follow all of its followers to get noticed by users.

This bot logs in to Instagram using Facebook credentials. It then searches for the account of interest and opens its follower list.
After loading all followers, it follows each user in the list. If a user is already being followed, it skips them.      
Similarly, it can also unfollow all followers of an account.
